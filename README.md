# responsive_portfolio

This project is my first attempt at a responsive portfolio site. It contains placeholders for projects I'll be adding to it, a quick bio, and my contact info including social media links.

This was created during the first week of my participation in the UCI Coding Bootcamp.

It includes three pages:
+ A homepage with the bio and a recent photo
+ A portfolio page with placeholders for coming projects
+ A contact page with an email form and links to my email and social media

This was built using the bootstrap styling library. I attempted to limit my use of @media and rely on HTML and CSS to create most of the responsive features. Each page handles this differently. The homepage is fairly responsive but large images and blocks of text create a few jumps. The portfolio page is the most clunky with the use of bootstrap cards -- this was where I relied on @media the most for the final jump to a single column. The contact page has one major change in responsiveness and is the most fluid by far.
